Hello! 

I'm Adam Janzi, a student at BTH. 
Besides being a student, I'm also a musician (drummer). 
I play in a progressive metalband from Denmark called VOLA, and I also play drums live for the Swedish popartist Dotter.  
These days, I mostly record drums in my homestudio for various bands and artists. The only shows I play these days are a few select shows with Dotter that can still take place, in radio and TV (because of COVID). 

As soon as COVID is over, I'll be able to start touring with VOLA again. We did three tours in Europe in 2018-2019 and we plan to tour more whenever it will be possible again.  
Until then, I will keep playing the few possible shows and keep recording session-work in my homestudio.  
And ofcourse, I wont forget to study aswell! :)
