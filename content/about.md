<h2>About</h2>

<p>This is my very own design-page.</p>
<p>I use a few different techniques on this website.
Except the usual things as PHP, HTML & CSS, I also use Markdown and SASS. 
I have created my own theme called "Janzi", containing the file "index.twig" which dictates the page layout. 
With the markdown-files, I add most of the content of the pages, such as the icons, the text and the titles etc.</p>
<p>With SASS, I decide the layout with two files; style.scss & variables.scss.
The variables-file contains the different color-variables for my style. 
The style-file calls those variables, and also contains the style-choices for the rest. 
Thanks to lint and npm, this is easily generated to the css-file, making the design much faster and easier to load.</p>
